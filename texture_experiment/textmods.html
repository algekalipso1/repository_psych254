    <!--mmturkey manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, turk, and attaches five properties to it, hitId, assignmentId, workerId, previewMode, and turkSubmitTo. It also provides a single method, submit(data), which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), submit displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like workerId and assignmentId). -->

      <p class="block-text">In this experiment we will show you sets of three pictures. One of those
      pictures will be different than the other two. In each case you will see either one or two "original textures" and one or two "synthesized textures." If there is one "original texture" then there will be two synthesized textures, and vice versa. The synthesized texture is intended to look as similar as possible to the original texture. Your task will be to identify the "odd one out" of the three (if there is one synthesized, then choose that, and if there is one original then choose that). <br> <br> 
      You will be shown an equilateral triangle and you will have to center your vision by looking at the dot in the center of the triangle.
