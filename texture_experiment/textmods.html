    <!--mmturkey manages submitting data to Mechanical Turk. This defines a global object, turk, and attaches five properties to it, hitId, assignmentId, workerId, previewMode, and turkSubmitTo. It also provides a single method, submit(data), which you use to submit data to Turk. If no submission URL has been provided (because, e.g. you're testing your code outside of the Turk environment), submit displays what would have been submitted (without, obviously, any Turk-specific variables like workerId and assignmentId). -->

      <p class="block-text">In this experiment we will show you sets of three pictures arranged in an equilateral triangle. One of the three pictures will be more different than the other two in some way. Your task will be to identify the "odd one out" in each of the trials. In other words, identify the picture that is different from the other two by clicking on the corresponding button. <br> <br> You can press the key '1' instead of the 'left' button, the key '2' instead of the 'top' button, and the key '3' instead of the 'right' button, and press the space bar to show the images.

      <br> <br> 
      There will be a little 'X' at the center of the equilateral triangle. Stare at that center and only look at the pictures in your peripheral vision. <br> <br>
      There will be 4 example trials for you to familiarize yourself with the task, and 66 real trials.
